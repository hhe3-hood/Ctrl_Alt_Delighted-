        About TimePal ✨
    </h1>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color:#555; max-width: 750px; margin: 0 auto;">
        TimePal is a pastel-themed academic planner designed to help students balance
        school, work, and personal life with clarity and calm. Created for 
        <strong>CS 524 – Principles of Software Engineering</strong>, TimePal began as a mobile-app concept
        and evolved into a fully realized web application built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
        Python, and SQL.

    <h2 style="color:#ff7bb0; margin-bottom: 10px;">🎯 Our Mission</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 750px; margin: 0 auto; color: #555;">
        Students often juggle multiple calendars — one for school, one for work, one for life —
        leading to clutter, confusion, and missed deadlines. TimePal solves this by offering a
        unified, student-focused platform for scheduling, planning, and tracking academic tasks.
        Our goal is simplicity, reliability, and supporting good study habits with gentle reminders
        and clear visual organization.

    <h2 style="color:#ff7bb0;">🌱 Our Origin Story</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 750px; margin: 0 auto; color:#555;">
        TimePal began as an ambitious mobile-app idea, but to deliver a polished and functional
        product within our semester timeline, we transitioned to a web-first approach. This decision
        allowed us to focus on core functionality, solid engineering principles, and a clean, usable
        interface — all essential components outlined in our Software Requirements Specification.

    <h2 style="color:#ff7bb0;">💖 A Thank-You</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 750px; margin: 0 auto; color:#555;">
        Thank you for exploring TimePal! We hope this project not only showcases our work
        in software engineering, but also helps students find balance in their busy lives.  
        Stay organized, stay motivated, and don’t forget to rest ✨
